# Getting Started with Developing CUDA-Q

This document contains guidelines for contributing to the code in this
repository. This document is relevant primarily for contributions to the `nvq++`
compiler, the CUDA-Q runtime, or to the integrated simulation backends. If you
would like to contribute applications and examples that use the CUDA-Q platform,
please follow the instructions for [installing CUDA-Q][official_install]
instead.

[official_install]: https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/quick_start.html#install-cuda-q

## Quick start guide

Before getting started with development, please create a fork of this repository
if you haven't done so already and make sure to check out the latest version on
the `main` branch. After following the instruction for [setting up your
development environment](./Dev_Setup.md) and [building CUDA-Q from
source](Building.md), you should be able to confirm that you can run the tests
and examples using your local build. If you edit [this
file](./runtime/nvqir/CircuitSimulator.h) to add a print statement

```c++
std::cout << "Custom registration of " << #PRINTED_NAME << "\n" << std::endl;
```

to the definition of the `NVQIR_REGISTER_SIMULATOR` macro, you should see this
line printed when you build the code and run an example using the command

```bash
bash "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/scripts/build_cudaq.sh" && \
nvq++ "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/docs/sphinx/applications/cpp/grover.cpp" -o grover.out && \
./grover.out
# Build with specific options - verbose, debug build, run 8 jobs in parallel
bash "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/scripts/build_cudaq.sh" -v -c Debug -j 8
```

Incremental Rebuilds
After making changes, you can rebuild specific components without rebuilding everything:

```bash
cd "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/build"
# Rebuild - faster than full build from scratch
ninja
# Rebuild specific component
ninja <target>
```

When working on compiler internals, it can be useful to look at intermediate
representations for CUDA-Q kernels.

To see how the kernels in [this
example](./docs/sphinx/applications/cpp/grover.cpp) are translated, you
can run

```bash
cudaq-quake $CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/docs/sphinx/applications/cpp/grover.cpp
```

to see its representation in the Quake MLIR dialect. To see its translation to
[QIR](https://www.qir-alliance.org/), you can run

```bash
cudaq-quake $CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/docs/sphinx/applications/cpp/grover.cpp |
cudaq-opt --canonicalize --add-dealloc |
quake-translate --convert-to=qir
```

## Code style

With regards to code format and style, we distinguish public APIs and CUDA-Q
internals. Public APIs should follow the style guide of the respective language,
specifically [this guide][cpp_style] for C++, and the [this guide][python_style]
for Python. The CUDA-Q internals on the other hand follow the [MLIR/LLVM style
guide][llvm_style]. Please ensure that your code includes comprehensive doc
comments as well as a comment at the top of the file to indicating its purpose.

[python_style]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
[cpp_style]: https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html
[llvm_style]: https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html

### C++ Formatting

```bash
bash "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/scripts/run_clang_format.sh"
```

### Python Formatting

```bash
yapf -i <file_name>.py
# To run recursively on a directory
yapf -i --recursive <directory>
```

### Spell checker

```bash
bash "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/scripts/run_all_spelling.sh"
# To only check the files that have changed from `main`
bash "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/scripts/run_all_spelling.sh" -d
```

## Testing and debugging

CUDA-Q tests are categorized as unit tests on runtime library code and
`FileCheck` tests on compiler code output. All code added under the runtime
libraries should have an accompanying test added to the appropriate spot in the
`unittests` folder. All code that directly impacts compiler code should have an
accompanying `FileCheck` test. These tests are located in the `test` folder.

### C++ tests

```bash
cd "$CUDAQ_REPO_ROOT/build"
ctest
# To run a specific test
ctest -R <test-name>
```

### Python tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -v python/tests/ --ignore python/tests/backends
for backendTest in python/tests/backends/*.py; do python3 -m pytest -v $backendTest; done
```

When running a CUDA-Q executable locally, the verbosity of the output can be
configured by setting the `CUDAQ_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Setting its
value to `info` will enable printing of informational messages, and setting its
value to `trace` generates additional messages to trace the execution. These
logs can be directed to a file by setting the `CUDAQ_LOG_FILE` variable when
invoking the executable, e.g.

```bash
CUDAQ_LOG_FILE=grover_log.txt CUDAQ_LOG_LEVEL=info grover.out
```

## Building and Testing Python Wheels

To test your changes as a Python wheel, use the wheel build script:

```bash
# Linux (specify CUDA version)
bash scripts/build_wheel.sh -c 12   # CUDA 12
bash scripts/build_wheel.sh -c 13   # CUDA 13

# macOS (CPU-only)
bash scripts/build_wheel.sh -p
```

The wheel will be placed in `dist/` by default.

**Note**: On macOS, use `-p` to ensure prerequisites are installed.
The script is idempotent and skips already-installed dependencies.

### Build Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c <12\|13>` | CUDA version (required on Linux, ignored on macOS) |
| `-o <dir>` | Output directory (default: `dist`) |
| `-a <dir>` | External simulator assets directory (default: `assets`) |
| `-p` | Install prerequisites before building |
| `-T <toolchain>` | Install prerequisites with toolchain (e.g., `gcc12`, `llvm`), implies `-p` |
| `-t` | Run validation tests after build |
| `-q` | Quick test mode (core tests only, implies `-t`) |
| `-v` | Verbose output |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PYTHON` | Python interpreter to use (default: `python3`) |
| `CUDA_QUANTUM_VERSION` | Version string for the wheel (default: `0.0.0`) |

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build and run quick validation tests
bash scripts/build_wheel.sh -t -q

# Build with specific version
CUDA_QUANTUM_VERSION=0.9.0 bash scripts/build_wheel.sh -t
```

### Validation Only

To run validation tests on an existing wheel without rebuilding:

```bash
# Auto-detects test files from repo structure
bash scripts/validate_pycudaq.sh -v 0.9.0 -i dist

# Quick test mode
bash scripts/validate_pycudaq.sh -v 0.9.0 -i dist -q
```

The validation script sets up a staging directory at `build/validation/` with
symlinks to the test files.
